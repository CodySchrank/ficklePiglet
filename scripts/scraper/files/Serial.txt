Serial is a podcast from the creators of This American Life, hosted by Sarah Koenig. Serial unfolds one story - a true story - over the course of a whole season. The show follows the plot and characters wherever they lead, through many surprising twists and turns. Sarah won't know what happens at the end of the story until she gets there, not long before you get there with her. Each week she'll bring you the latest chapter, so it's important to listen in, starting with Episode 1. New episodes are released on Thursday mornings.CIA, FBI, YouTube, the Portland PD? There was no handbook for getting Bergdahl back.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/E1EQyPhXfSE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>A note from Sarah about our every-other-week schedule.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/Io1fI-Jzo2M" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>What's happening on the other side of the door?<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/4DAtVjr4_SM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>Bergdahl’s first year in captivity starts with an escape and ends with an escape. In between, he learns necessary, twisted lessons of survival.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/RneNvVu4LMw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>On the move with Bergdahl, the Taliban slip past the U.S. Army’s massive effort to find him. During those days and weeks, each side is asking, what is Bergdahl worth to us?<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/3mhZ_2w7q84" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>In the middle of the night, Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl grabs a notebook, snacks, water, some cash. Then he quietly slips off a remote U.S. Army outpost in eastern Afghanistan and into the dark, open desert. About 20 minutes later, it occurs to him: he’s in over his head. <img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/Z98VP9-ki8s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>On January 13, 1999, Adnan Syed was a hurt and vengeful ex-boyfriend who carried out a premeditated murder. Or he was a bewildered bystander, framed for a crime he could never have committed. After 15 months of reporting, we take out everything we’ve got - interviews and documents and police reports - we shake it all out, and we see what sticks.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/EN17Uu_zwto" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>Almost everyone describes the 17-year-old Adnan the same way: good kid, helpful at the mosque, respectful to his elders. But a couple of months ago, Sarah started getting phone calls from people who knew Adnan back then, and told her stories of a different kind of boy.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/2jBxWKE77Oo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>Adnan’s trial lawyer was M. Cristina Gutierrez, a renowned defense attorney in Maryland – tough and savvy and smart. Other lawyers said she was exactly the kind of person you’d want defending you on a first-degree murder charge. But Adnan was convicted, and a year later, Gutierrez was disbarred. What happened? <img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/kOEzjfdp42E" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>New information is coming in about what maybe didn’t happen on January 13, 1999.  And while Adnan’s memory of that day is foggy at best, he does remember what happened next: being questioned, being arrested and, a little more than a year later, being sentenced to life in prison.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/8qJNC0l-S2A" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>The state’s case against Adnan Syed hinged on Jay’s credibility; he was their star witness and also, because of his changing statements to police, their chief liability. Naturally, Adnan’s lawyer tried hard to make Jay look untrustworthy at trial. So, how did the jurors make sense of Jay? For that matter, how did the cops make sense of Jay? How are we supposed to make sense of Jay?<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/0jfvfEzHHlc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>Adnan told Sarah about a case in Virginia that had striking similarities to his own: one key witness, incriminating cell phone records, young people, drugs - and a defendant who has always maintained his innocence. Sarah called up one of the defense attorneys on that case to see if she could offer any insight into Adnan’s case, and got much more than she bargained for.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/C5cu4eB4EBk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>The physical evidence against Adnan Syed was scant - a few underwhelming fingerprints. So aside from cell records, what did the prosecutors bring to the jury, to shore up Jay's testimony? Sarah weighs all the other circumstantial evidence they had against Adnan, including curious behavior, a disconcerting note, and an unexplained mid-afternoon phone call.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/luzKOc-1vaU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>Adnan once issued a challenge to Sarah. He told her to test the state’s timeline of the murder by driving from Woodlawn High School to Best Buy in 21 minutes. It can’t be done, he said. So Sarah and Dana take up the challenge, and raise him one: They try to recreate the entire route that Jay said he and Adnan took on January 13th, 1999. <img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/_4nNtTjgZI4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>A few days after Hae’s body is found, the detectives get a lead that opens the case up for them. They find Jay at work late one night and bring him down to Homicide. At first, he insists he doesn’t know anything about the murder. But eventually he comes clean. He tells them what happened on January 13th. A few weeks later, he’s back at Homicide and his story has changed. In some ways, these changes are small and understandable. In other ways, they’re big and confounding.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/Zwr-2iNgrXk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>It’s February 9, 1999. Hae has been missing for three weeks. A man on his lunch break pulls off a road to pee, and stumbles on her body in a city forest. His odd recounting of the discovery makes Detectives Ritz and MacGillivary suspicious. For instance, why did he walk so far into the woods - 127 feet - to relieve himself? And that’s just the start. A look into the man’s past reveals some bizarre behavior.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/zsYOyC2Ljyw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>Their relationship began like a storybook high-school romance: a prom date, love notes, sneaking off to be alone. But unlike other kids at school, they had to keep their dating secret, because their parents disapproved. Both of them, but especially Adnan, were under special pressure at home, and the stress of that spilled over into their relationship. Eventually Hae broke up with Adnan. And then, depending on who you ask, Adnan was either understandably sad and moping around, or full of rage and plotting to kill her.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/8S8WkuVAFY8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>It's Baltimore, 1999. Hae Min Lee, a popular high-school senior, disappears after school one day. Six weeks later detectives arrest her classmate and ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed, for her murder. He says he's innocent - though he can't exactly remember what he was doing on that January afternoon. But someone can. A classmate at Woodlawn High School says she knows where Adnan was. The trouble is, she’s nowhere to be found. <img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/5ycPwkd6LAY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>
